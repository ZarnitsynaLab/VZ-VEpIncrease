The file ‘RCodeVaccine2024.Rmd’ contains the code used to generate the figures for the paper by Dean N.E., Halloran B., and Zarnitsyna V.I., published in Vaccine (2024).
You can click the 'Knit' button to generate a PDF file with all the figures or run the corresponding chunks for each figure separately.

Please note that the lines responsible for data generation are commented out in most code chunks, as executing them may take several hours (e.g., for Figures 3 and 4) 
or even several days (e.g., for Figure 5) when run on a laptop. To facilitate further analysis, all corresponding .csv files have been pre-generated and are included in the repository.
